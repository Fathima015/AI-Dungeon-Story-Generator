[Fantasy] once upon a time..

This is how the story ends: the man from the land who had a good time on the island and was able to live on it is suddenly attacked by monsters called "Sombreros" and he is forced to kill everyone he touches. The man was told by the princess to kill the sombreros to prevent their return. And now he is back in his original place.

The ending comes to a close and this is one of the reasons the game was written so long ago.

In my opinion, this game is extremely well done, its only minor flaw is that the ending is very short and it does not do any favors for the ending (no matter how hard you try to figure out who the other character is or what they really believe) which could be a major issue on a sequel.

The end of this game really shines when you look at what it takes to make it to the end. The final version of this game is a big jump forward, and it also shows that things like the island and its people aren't the only obstacles that can cause problems for other game's.

In the end, if you want to do well with a remake, do it with a lot of time and dedication.

So, I would definitely recommend it!
